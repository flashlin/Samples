On a hot day, the little ants were busily working.

They scurried across the ground, searching for food and storing provisions for the upcoming winter.

Suddenly, one little ant discovered something huge on the grass—a big watermelon, 
lying there quietly, its green skin adorned with dark green stripes, emitting a tempting sheen.

The little ant was extremely excited: 
"The sweet watermelon is so delicious! I must run back to the ant nest immediately and tell the others this good news!"

All the other little ants were very happy when they heard this. 
If they could bring the big watermelon home, 
it would be enough to feed them for a good while.

But the watermelon was so big, how could they move it home? 
The little ants sat together and began to brainstorm. 
They decided that all the little ants would come out and push the big watermelon together.

So, hundreds of little ants worked together, grabbing the watermelon’s skin with their tiny hands and feet, 
and began the difficult journey of moving it.

They chanted, "Heave ho! Heave ho!" encouraging each other as they pushed, rested, and continued forward.

The sun hung high in the sky, making the little ants sweat profusely, 
but they didn’t give up because they knew that the power of teamwork was strong.

Slowly, the watermelon began to move little by little. 
Though progress was slow, the little ants never thought of giving up.

At this moment, the flowers, pebbles, and wind nearby also came to help. 
The flowers bent down to provide shade for the little ants; the pebbles paved a smooth path, 
making it easier for the watermelon to roll; the breeze gently blew, bringing a bit of coolness to the little ants.

After a long time of hard work, finally, at sunset, the watermelon was successfully moved to the entrance of the ant nest.

The little ants cheered and danced happily around the watermelon. 
They knew they were not only celebrating bringing back the watermelon but also their unity and perseverance.

All the ants in the nest shared the sweet watermelon, and its taste was sweeter than any food they had ever eaten. 
The little ants chatted and discussed the day's adventure, their hearts filled with happiness and pride.

Dear children, the story of the ants moving the watermelon tells us that no matter how difficult something is, 
as long as we unite and work together, there is nothing we cannot achieve. 
Each little ant may be small, but when everyone’s strength is combined, miracles can be created.
