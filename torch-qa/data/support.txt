# How to add a new B2B2C domain ?
Assuming that NOC is ready to provide the following domain for us to add: abc.net

Here are the steps to add a new b2b2c domain:
1. Go to the http://dba-sb-prod.coreop.net/ Artimes website.
   Check whether these domains already exist in the InfoDb.AuthroizedDomain table.

2. Go to the https://forseti-api-a.sbotopex.com/swagger/index.html website.

3. If "abc.net" already exists in the InfoDb.AuthroizedDomain table:
   Perform a POST request to /api/public/AdminAuthorizedDomain/DeleteDomain to delete "abc.net" from the database.

4. Perform a POST request to /api/public/AdminAuthorizedDomain/InsertDomain to insert "abc.net" domain.

5. After the insertion is successful, check the result at http://forseti-api-a.sbotopex.com/domain.

6. If "abc.net" is intended for use in China, set the domain to "disable" in the database to prevent it from being used by agents from other countries.

7. If "abc.net" uses the HTTPS protocol, go to the http://dragonballz.coreop.net/ website and modify the AcceptHttpsDomain key value in the global_settings of the Forseti website to include "abc.net".

8. In the git Forseti pipeline, select "production:reload" to reload the global_settings configuration.

9. Restart the pods of the following projects:
   - Tera Backend
   - Pollux (SG Support or Hinoki should execute the necessary commands to restart pollux)

The following is the command to restart the pollux pod
```
gcloud auth list
gcloud auth login erwin.chang@appsafe.org
gcloud container clusters get-credentials host-prod --region asia-east1 --project host-prod-6751d597
kubectl rollout restart deployment tera-backend -n product-platform
kubectl rollout restart deployment pollux-asi -n airgile
kubectl rollout restart deployment pollux-bsi -n airgile
```

10. Go to https://atlas.coreop.net/reload and select odin -> "Reload Authorized Domain".

11. Use the new domain to explore our site and check if everything is working correctly.
    - Verify there are no issues when switching between casual site products.
    - Check desktop login and product switching.
    - Verify the register and deposit pages are functioning properly.
    - After binding the domain to an agent, check if the register page shows B2B2C register and the correct agent number.
    - After binding the domain to an agent, test typing the URL www.numbersite.com on a mobile device to see if it redirects to the casual site.

# How to convert a B2B2C domain to a B2C domain:
1. Go to the http://forseti-api-a.sbotopex.com website.
2. Select the "Demo CRUD" button.
3. As an example, search for the B2B2C domain "67146750.com" and disable it while providing the reason for the change.
   If there are any issues, ensure that frontline support is informed.

If you want to switch to the SBOBET domain:
Notify NOC to configure the domain as non-B2B2C.
Otherwise, the website will redirect to the casual site instead of the classic site (e.g., m.67146750.com).

In practice,
SBOBET should go to the classic site.
SBOTOP should redirect to the casual site (play.67146750.com).
