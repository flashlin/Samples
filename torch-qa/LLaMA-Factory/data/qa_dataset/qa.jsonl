{"instruction": "How to Add Versioning to ASP.NET Core Web API?", "input": "", "output": "Originally, the package was named Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning.\r\nHowever, the author later left Microsoft.\r\nThe package was initially a standalone project maintained by the author.\r\nAs a result, it was moved under the .NET Foundation and its name was changed to Asp.Versioning.* (varies based on different project types) for continued maintenance.\r\nThe older package versions will remain at v5, while the new versions have now reached v7.\r\nIf you are using .NET 5 or earlier, you can continue using the older package;\r\nhowever, it is recommended to switch to the new package for future versions.\r\nLater on, I will demonstrate the usage in an ASP.NET Core Web API project using .NET 7. For this purpose,\r\nI have installed the Asp.Versioning.Mvc package.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ndotnet add package Asp.Versioning.Mvc --version 7.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the installation, add the service in Program.cs.\r\n```\r\n// Program.cs\r\nbuilder.Services.AddApiVersioning().AddMvc();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, prepare two controllers and set up the same route for them.\r\n```\r\n// SampleController.cs\r\n[Route(\"Sample\")]\r\n[ApiVersion(1.0)] // This is optional; the default version is 1.0.\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class SampleController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic IActionResult Get()\r\n{\r\nreturn Ok(new { version = \"1.0\" });\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// SampleV2Controller.cs\r\n[Route(\"Sample\")]\r\n[ApiVersion(2.0)]\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class SampleV2Controller : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic IActionResult Get()\r\n{\r\nreturn Ok(new { version = \"2.0\" });\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, we can obtain the corresponding API version results through the query string.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/sample?api-version=1.0 or /sample?api-version=2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, you might notice that if no parameter is added,\r\nthe result won't be found. In such cases,\r\nyou can include a parameter to automatically route to the default version when no specific version is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Promgram.cs\r\nbuilder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options => {\r\noptions.AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified = true;\r\noptions.DefaultApiVersion = new ApiVersion(1, 0); // This is optional; the default version is 1.0.\r\n}).AddMvc();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to customize the query string name, you can set it through parameters.\r\n```\r\n// Promgram.cs\r\nbuilder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options => {\r\n...\r\noptions.ApiVersionReader = new QueryStringApiVersionReader(\"v\");\r\n}).AddMvc();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to differentiate versions through URLs like v1 and v2 instead of using the query string, you can achieve this by adding routes.\r\n```\r\n[Route(\"api/v{version:apiVersion}/Sample\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, you can access the corresponding version through version-numbered URLs.\r\n```\r\n/api/v1/sample or /api/v2/sample\r\n```\r\n\r\nEarlier, we differentiated different versions using separate controllers.\r\nIf you'd like to keep them within the same controller,\r\nthat's also possible.\r\n\r\nContinuing from the previous example, above v2,\r\nyou can add v3 and create a new v3 action,\r\nspecifying the version using MapToApiVersion.\r\n```\r\n// SampleV2Controller.cs\r\n[Route(\"Sample\")]\r\n[Route(\"api/v{version:apiVersion}/sample\")]\r\n[ApiVersion(2.0)]\r\n[ApiVersion(3.0)]\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class SampleV2Controller : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic IActionResult Get()\r\n{\r\nreturn Ok(new { version = \"2.0\" });\r\n}\r\n\r\n[HttpGet]\r\n[MapToApiVersion(3.0)]\r\npublic IActionResult GetV3()\r\n{\r\nreturn Ok(new { version = \"3.0\" });\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to these methods, you can also differentiate versions through headers.\r\nSimply include the following method within the parameters.\r\n```\r\n// Promgram.cs\r\nbuilder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options => {\r\n...\r\noptions.ApiVersionReader = new HeaderApiVersionReader(\"x-ms-version\");\r\n}).AddMvc();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you wish to mix and match, you can use ApiVersionReader.Combine to specify multiple methods.\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options => {\r\n...\r\noptions.ApiVersionReader = ApiVersionReader.Combine(\r\nnew HeaderApiVersionReader(\"x-ms-version\"),\r\nnew QueryStringApiVersionReader(\"v\"));\r\n}).AddMvc();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you plan to deprecate older versions in the future, you can set Deprecated to true.\r\nThis way, when calling the API, the header will indicate its deprecation to remind developers using it.\r\n```\r\n[ApiVersion(1.0, Deprecated = true)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, to see this message in the header,\r\nyou need to include the configuration, which will add additional information to the returned header.\r\n```\r\nbuilder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options => {\r\n...\r\noptions.ReportApiVersions = true;\r\n}).AddMvc();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter adding versioning, if you were using Swagger to present the API documentation page,\r\nyou might notice that it's not supported out of the box.\r\nIn this case, some adjustments will be necessary to ensure proper display.\r\n```ERROR\r\nFail to load API definition.\r\nFetch error\r\nresponse status is 500 https://localhost:7000/swagger/v1/swagger.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you didn't have Swagger installed initially, you would need to add the following two packages: Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi and Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.

{"instruction": "The Significance of Implied Odds", "input": "", "output": "Bookmakers use probability to determine the odds they offer on a particular outcome.\r\nFor example, if a bookmaker calculates that a particular football team has a 50% chance of winning a game, they will base the odds around that probability. In this case, the fair decimal odds would be 2.0 (or even money), as the implied odds represent this chance: 1 / 2.0 = 50%.

{"instruction": "How bookmakers set their odds?", "input": "", "output": "If a bettor determines that the probability of an outcome is higher than the implied probability suggested by the odds offered, this would be a wise bet to place.\r\nFor example, if a team has a 60% chance of winning a game, and the bookmaker is offering odds of 1.8 on that team winning, the bettor may see value in placing a bet because the implied probability (55.6%) is lower than the bettor\u2019s estimated probability (60%). This is essentially value betting.", "history": []}

By picking value odds, the \u2018edge\u2019 is in the player\u2019s favour.\r\nhere\u2019s two main types of value bets:\r\n* Odds that go on to fall (i.e they drop). If you are able to pre-empt when odds will decline in value, then you\u2019re onto a winning strategy. When odds settle (just before the start of the sports event) at a lower price to what you\u2019ve backed, then what you have achieved is a \u201cvalue bet\u201d.\r\n* Odds that imply an outcome is less likely to occur than reality. Rather than predicting a fall in the odds (and relying entirely on the accuracy of the market), you may already know that the real chance of an outcome happening is more likely than the odds suggest. For example, if the odds on offer are 10/1 at a Bookmaker, but you\u2019ve calculated the \u201cfair\u201d chance as 7/1 then the payout on a win at the Bookmaker makes the bet profitable (assuming you\u2019re appraisal is accurate).

A lay bettor, on the other hand, could bet against Manchester United winning the match, effectively betting on Liverpool or a draw.\r\nWhen you place a lay bet, you are essentially taking on the role of a bookmaker. This means that if the outcome you bet against happens, you will have to pay out the winnings to the person who bet on it. This potential payout is known as as the liability of a lay bet.\r\nOn the other hand, if the outcome you bet against does not happen, you get to keep the stake that was placed by the other person, minus any commission that may be charged by the platform or betting exchange you used to place the bet.\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that lay betting is done through a betting exchange rather than a traditional bookmaker.", "history": []}

This means you can place a lay bet to cover your initial bet, reducing your risk and ensuring you don\u2019t lose money if the outcome goes against you.\r\n* No Liability Limitations: With lay betting, there are no limitations on the amount you can win.
