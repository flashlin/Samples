# Participation Instructions and Bet Options
To place a bet, the Player moves the cursor to the pictures of the chips in the lower-right corner of the game window and left-click the chip value that they want to use. The Player then moves the cursor to the Betting Area on the table layout marked as players or bankers, tie or pair, then left-clicks to place their bets. The chip will automatically appear in the betting box, with the total value of the bet written alongside. The bet amount will also appear at the bottom of the window.

Each left-click will increase the bet value by one chip of the same value, up to the maximum bet for that table. If the Player wants to use a different chip value of this bet, they must move the cursor back to the pictures of the chips at the lower-right corner of the game window on the screen and left-click on the new chip value that they want to use. Then the Player must move the cursor back to the Betting Area on the table layout, and left-click again to increase the bet.

Players must place their bets before the Betting Timer at the centre of the game window expires. Betting is not allowed once the Betting Timer has expired.

DOUBLE bet button will enable player to double up all the unconfirmed bets which have been placed on the table. Any bet which has been placed and confirmed will not be doubled.

All bets are confirmed and taken into the Player's account once the CONFIRM BET button is left-clicked. Any bets placed after the CONFIRM BET button has been left-clicked but before the Betting Timer has expired must be followed by the CONFIRM BET button being left-clicked. If this is not done, then these additional bets will NOT be confirmed and NOT taken into the Player's account.

To remove all bets from the table layout, left-click the CLEAR BETS button. To remove the last bet from the table layout, left click the UNDO button. Note both CLEAR BETS and UNDO can only be done before the CONFIRM BET button has been left-clicked. If the  CLEAR BETS is left-clicked, then these bets will NOT be confirmed and NOT taken into the Player's account.

As soon as the Betting Timer has expired, the dealer will deal two hands of cards, which are called the player's hand and the banker's hand. All cards are dealt face up. The cards will be drawn in the following order:
1. The first card for the player's hand.
2. The first card for the banker's hand.
3. The second card for the player's hand.
4. The second card for the banker's hand.
5. If dictated by the drawing rules, the third card for the player's hand.
6. If dictated by the drawing rules, the third card for the banker's hand.
More than three cards can never be drawn for either hand.

There are no values greater than nine in the game of baccarat. All card values are recalculated when the combined value of two or more cards is greater than nine. This new card value is determined by subtracting ten from the combined card value every time it reaches a number greater than nine. Below are a few examples of this equation.

4 + 2 + 6 = 2

5 + 6 + 8 = 9

7 + 3 = 0

10 + 10 + 10 = 0

The hand with the highest point value wins. All losing bets will be collected and all winning bets paid. If a bet is a winner, the winnings will be posted to the credit balance and updated in the credits display upon selecting the next game or upon returning to the Lobby.

If both hands have the same point value, that game is a tie and neither side wins or loses. In this case, tie bets win, but players and bankers bets do not win or lose so the bet is refunded back to the Player.
