For example, you could bet on number 21 and on various other numbers that are adjacent to number 21 on the table, on all the BLACK numbers, on all the ODD numbers, and on the THIRD DOZEN numbers. When the ball falls into a number, some of these bets win, and some lose. The secret is to win more than you lose!
