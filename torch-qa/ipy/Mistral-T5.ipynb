[/INST] Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen! </s><s> [INST] Do you have mayonnaise recipes? [/INST] I don't have specific written recipes, but for a simple homemade mayonnaise, mix egg yolks from 2 large eggs with 1 teaspoon of mustard, a pinch of salt, pepper and a few drops of vinegar. Gradually add around 1 cup of light olive oil while whisking it all together vigorously until it thickens. You'll have a delicious homemade mayonnaise! However, always be careful with raw eggs. This isn't always recommended for those with compromised immune systems or health conditions. [/INST] Is there a vegetarian alternative to mayonnaise? [/INST] Yes, there are many alternatives to regular mayonnaise. Vegans or those who wish to avoid animal products can opt for plant-based mayonnaise, which uses plant oils and often includes vegetable-derived proteins to mimic the texture and flavor. Another option is to make a vegetarian-friendly sauce with mashed avocado and yogurt, or pureed white beans with olive oil and vinegar. These options offer a similar taste and use different ingredients for a healthier alternative. [/INST] What do you use sesame oil for? [/INST] Sesame oil has a nutty flavor and is commonly used in Asian cuisines, especially in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean dishes. It's often used for stir-frying, cooking, enhancing flavors, and as a healthful dressing on salads. Apart from cooking, sesame oil is also used in some traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese cures for colds, coughs, skin conditions, and to soothe digestive issues. In non-culinary contexts, it's part of certain traditional medicinal and aromatherapy remedies. [/INST] Are there different flavours of Sriracha? If so, what are they? [/INST] There are several variations of Sriracha available now, each with a slightly different flavor, heat level, or texture. Some popular flavors are classic chili pepper, garlic, sweet mango, pineapple, and lime, to name a few. They are either made by blending the original Sriracha sauce with additional ingredients or creating an entirely new sauce with a specific focus. People often experiment with different ingredients to create unique versions that can enhance the overall taste for various cuisines. [/INST] What food pairs well with kimchi? [/INST] Kimchi pairs well with a variety of dishes as it gives a burst of spicy and sour flavor. It's often associated with Korean cuisine, but you can match it with many others too. Pairings could include bibimbap, rice or noodle bowls, grilled meats, stews, fried or baked tofu, eggs, fresh vegetables, and even sandwiches or burgers for a delightful kick. Kimchi also works well with various cheeses, especially aged and strongly flavored ones. [/INST] How long does sauce last when stored in the fridge? [/INST] It depends on the type of sauce. Homemade sauces can last from a few days to weeks when stored in the fridge, depending on the ingredients. Most bottled sauces have a best-before or use-by date mentioned on the packaging. In general, it's recommended to check the quality of a sauce by using your sense of smell and taste before consuming. If it has an off odor or tastes funny, discard it. [/INST] Is garlic good to eat with cheese? [/INST] Yes, garlic and cheese go great together! The combination can enhance the creaminess of the cheese and add a delicious depth of flavor. You can use it for dishes like garlic bread, roasted garlic and cheese-topped vegetables, or simply spread a garlic and cheese mix on crackers. This pair can also be incorporated into appetizers, pasta, or pastries, adding complexity to your dish. [/INST] What are the main ingredients needed to make salsa dip? [/INST] A basic salsa dip typically has four main ingredients: chopped tomatoes, onions, cilantro (coriander), and sliced chilies (often jalape√±o for a mild heat). Other commonly used ingredients include lime juice or vinegar for acidity, salt and pepper for seasoning, and sometimes garlic, cumin, and spices like ground coriander or paprika for added flavor. Depending on preference, the salsa might also include avocado (for guacamole), mango, pineapple, or even bell peppers for a different twist\""
