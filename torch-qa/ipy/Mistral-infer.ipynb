[/INST]While I don't have the ability to create or prepare recipes myself, I can certainly help you find one for mayonnaise! Here's a classic and simple Homemade Mayonnaise recipe you can try:\\n\\nIngredients:\\n- 1 cup (240 ml) light tasting oil (like canola, safflower, or vegetable oil)\\n- 1 large egg yolk\\n- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) white wine vinegar or other mild vinegar\\n- 1 teaspoon (5 g) Dijon mustard\\n- 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) Kosher salt\\n- 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) Freshly ground black pepper\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Set up a large bowl with an immersion blender. This will make the process simpler. However, you can also use a regular blender or a whisk.\\n2. Add the egg yolk, vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper to the bowl.\\n3. With the immersion blender at the bottom, drizzle the oil into the egg mixture in a slow but steady stream. Turn on the blender and blend the oil and egg mixture together until you have a thick, creamy mayonnaise. The oil should be fully incorporated before adding more.\\n4. Taste the mayonnaise and adjust seasoning if needed. Add any additional herbs, spices or other ingredients according to your preference.\\n5. Store the mayonnaise in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to one week.\\n\\nLet me know if this helps, or if you have any other questions!</s>\""
