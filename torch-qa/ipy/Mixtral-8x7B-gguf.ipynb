       "\" Baccarat is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective of the game is for the player to predict whether the value of their hand will be closer to or equal to the value of the banker's hand. The game is usually played with eight decks of cards, and the value of each card is determined as follows: an ace counts as 1 point, a two through nine count as the face value of the card (for example, a seven counts as 7 points), and a ten or face card (king, queen) counts as 0 points. The total value of each player's hand is then calculated by adding together the values of all of the cards in that player's hand. For example, if a player was holding a two and an ace, the total value of their hand would be calculated as follows: 2 (two) + 1 (ace) = 3 points. Similarly, if a player was holding a seven and an eight, the total value of their hand would be calculated as follows: 7 (seven) + 8 (eight) = 15 points. However, since the game is usually played with eight decks of cards, and there are only two\""
