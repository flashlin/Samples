# Why does SBOTOP restrict under age individuals?

__112 __Thu, Aug 27, 2020 __[Rules & Regulations](https://help.sbotop.com/category/rules-regulations/256/ "Categories » Rules & Regulations ")

SBOTOP takes a strong stand in being a socially responsible bookmaker while providing our customers with an enjoyable gaming experience. For this reason age restrictions are imposed depending on your country of residence. The applicable minimum age is 21 years or for certain countries 18 years of age, or the legal minimum age in your country of residence (whichever is higher) to open an account with SBOTOP.

It is against the law for under age individuals to gamble and for the prevention of unlawful betting, we require your personal information and documentary proof to verify your identity and that you are of legal age to use our services.
