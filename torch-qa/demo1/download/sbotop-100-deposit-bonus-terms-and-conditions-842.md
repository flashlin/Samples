## How it works:

1\. Make an initial deposit and we will credit 100% deposit bonus up to _**RM 300** _ to play on Sports .

2\. _**15x Rollover** _ on both your deposit and bonus.

  


## *Conditions:

1\. Applies to new account holders with Initial Deposit for Sportsbook.

2\. To join the promotion, the customer must enter the promo code on the registration page.

3\. Your account will be automatically credited with the Bonus upon completion of your Initial Deposit. The Bonus amount and Deposit amount used to generate the bonus has to be rollover 15 times before withdrawal is permitted. The Deposit amount not used for the promotion is subject to ONE (1) time rollover.   
For Example: Player A joined the deposit bonus and made an initial deposit of RM 500.   
• Bonus amount: RM 500 x 100% = capped to RM 300.   
  
• Deposit amount used to generate the bonus: RM 300/100% = RM 300.   
  
• Deposit amount not used for the promotion: RM 500 – RM 300 = RM 200.

• Before any withdrawal can be made, Player A is subjected to rollover:   
  
(RM 300 + RM 300) x 15 + RM 200 = RM 9,200.

4\. Withdrawal is NOT ALLOWED when the promotion is running unless the required rollover is completed or Promotion Cancelled. Cancellation of Promotion will result in bonus and all the winnings (IF ANY) to be forfeited.

5\. Subsequent deposit is subject to ONE (1) time rollover.
