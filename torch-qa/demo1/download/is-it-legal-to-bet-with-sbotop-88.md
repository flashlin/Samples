__88 __Thu, Aug 27, 2020 __[Rules & Regulations](https://help.sbotop.com/category/rules-regulations/256/ "Categories » Rules & Regulations ")

SBOTOP holds legal licences issued by authorized commissions to conduct online gambling. However, as legal regulations and restrictions pertaining to online gambling and gaming vary from country to country, online gambling may be illegal in certain jurisdictions. Unfortunately, SBOTOP is not able to accept bets made by customers from these countries.

It is thus important to ensure that the laws applicable to you concerning online gambling and gaming do not prohibit you from opening an account and betting with SBOTOP.
