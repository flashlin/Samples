Answer: Three Faces Baccarat is a variant of baccarat that features three face-up cards on the table, with the objective of predicting which hand will have a higher score. The game has a 97.59% RTP and follows standard baccarat rules, with some minor variations.
Here are the basic rules:

1. Place your bet: Choose your preferred bet type (player, banker, or tie) and place your bet.
2. The deal: Three cards are dealt face-up on the table: one for the player, one for the banker, and one for the tie hand.
3. Evaluate the hands: Based on the values of the three cards, determine which hand has a higher score.
4. Determine the winner: The hand with the highest score wins. If the player's score is higher than the banker's score, the player wins; if the banker's score is higher, the banker wins; and if the scores are tied, the tie hand wins.
