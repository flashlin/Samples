Question: How to calculate the card value in Baccarat?
Answer: In Baccarat, the card values are calculated as follows:
* Aces are worth 1 point.
* Cards 2 through 9 are worth their face value in points, e.g., 2 is worth 2 points, 9 is worth 9 points.
* 10s, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 0 points.
For example, if you have an 8 and a Queen, the total value of the hand is 8 (8 points) + 0 (Queen is 0 points) = 8 points

Q: In baccarat, if the player has a 2 and a 3, and the banker has a Queen and an Ace, how will the outcome be handled?
Answer: In specific situations, the player (also known as 'player' or 'punto') and the banker (also known as 'bank' or 'banco') may be required to draw a third card in Baccarat. These rules are based on the total value of the first two cards dealt to the player and banker. The specific rules are as follows:
If the player's initial two-card total is between 0 and 6, a third card may be drawn based on specific rules.
If the player's initial two-card total is 7, 8, or 9, no third card will be drawn for the player.
If a third card is drawn for the players hand, the decision to draw a third card for the bankers hand is made automatically according to standard casino rules as below.

|Total of First Two Cards |Draw when the players third card is |Stand when the players third card is
|--|--|--
|0,1,2 |0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |
|3 |0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 |8
|4 |2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |0, 1, 8, 9
|5 |4, 5, 6, 7 |0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
|6 |6, 7 |0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
|7 |Stand |
|8,9 |Stand (Natural)

Dragon Tiger typically has a faster pace and is simpler as it only involves comparing the values of two cards.
