Question: Introduction to Non-handicap
Answer: The non-handicap method is also known as 'outright' or 'PK.' It's simpler than the handicap method. You simply choose a team, and if they win, you earn money. Your earnings equal the bet amount multiplied by the odds. But the most significant difference between handicap and non-handicap is that if you choose a strong team without a handicap, the odds are very low. For example, in the WBC Baseball Classic where Japan played against China, Japan was almost guaranteed to win. The non-handicap spread indicated Japan winning by 11.5 points, resulting in Japan's non-handicap odds possibly being as low as 1.01. Betting 100 might only yield 1 unit of profit.

Question: Introduction to Handicap
Answer: Handicap refers to a numerical value set by the bookmaker based on the teams' strengths. This value determines which team is ahead in the game. Players place bets on this value, and the final result of the match is judged based on this numerical value to determine the winner. In simple terms, handicap signifies winning by how many points. The bookmaker designates the stronger team as the handicap side, aiming to level the playing field for both teams on the betting platform.

Question: Provide a Handicap example
Answer: Here's an example of handicap betting in the English Premier League:
In a match between Manchester City (home) and Arsenal (away), the handicap is set at Manchester City -1.
Match outcomes:
Manchester City 2:0 Arsenal = Handicap side (Manchester City) wins.
Manchester City 2:1 Arsenal = Handicap draw.
Manchester City 2:2 Arsenal = Handicap opposition side (Arsenal) wins.

Question: What is Total over/under ?
Answer: Big and small is a type of sports betting where players wager on the total score of two teams' match.
Betting big means that the player believes the total score of the two teams' match will exceed a specific number. For example, if a player bets big on 10, they believe the total score of the two teams' match will exceed 10.
Betting small means that the player believes the total score of the two teams' match will be less than a specific number. For example, if a player bets small on 10, they believe the total score of the two teams' match will be less than 10.
For example, if the total score of the two teams' match is 10, the player who bets big will win their bet, while the player who bets small will lose their bet.
**If the total score of the two teams' match is 9, the player who bets big will lose 60% of their bet, while the player who bets small will win their bet.

Question: What is `Round Robin`?
Answer: A round robin is very similar to a standard parlay in that it is, in fact, just a combination of various parlays. With a round robin, you are able to combine a number of betting selections into a number of individual parlays.
Perhaps you have four total bets you want to round robin together into every parlay combination. Using a round robin builder at a sportsbook, these combinations will all be made for you rather than you having to create individual parlays manually.
A total of 11 parlays are possible with your four selections (if you include the full four-team parlay). It would take some thinking and time to place each parlay separately, while a round robin makes it easy.
A benefit of round robin betting is that you mitigate your risk compared to just placing a single parlay of all your selections. In the instance of a four-team round robin, if you bet a four-team parlay alone, you lose your money if one of the four teams loses. In contrast, with a round robin, you would still gain from three of the four selections hitting.
Round robins are a beneficial bet type both for convenience and risk management. The bad thing about round robins is that your upside is somewhat capped compared to placing a simple parlay for the same amount of money as your round robin.

Question: What is `Prop Bet`?
Answer: A prop bet is short for a “proposition” bet. It refers to a proposition regarding a player statistic, team statistic, or outcome in a sporting event overall.

Question: What are the odds types?
Answer:
* European Odds
* Malay Odds
* Indo Odds
* Hong Kong Odds


Question: What are Malaysian odds?
Question: What are Malay odds?
Answer: Also known as Malay odds, Malaysian odds are one of many odds formats. 
Odds are expressed in decimal format using plus (+) and minus (-) signs to indicate the favourite and underdog. 
If the odds are 0, then this means it’s a 50/50 bet and will pay out at even money.

Question: How are odds calculated in Malay?
Answer: Positive Malay odds are represented by a ‘+’ symbol or no symbol at all. The bigger the number, the more you win. For instance, let’s say you bet on over 2.5 goals in a football match between Manchester United and Chelsea at Malay odds of 0. You stand to win $100 for every $100 you put down.

Question: How do I convert Malay odds to decimal odds?
Answer: To convert positive Malay odds to decimal, simply add 1. So Malay odds of 1.5 will be 2.5 in decimal. 
Converting negative Malay odds to decimal requires you to divide 1 by the Malay odds and add 1. 
The formula for Malay odds of -1.5 is (1 / 1.5 = 0.67) + 1 = 1.67.


Question: What is the calculation formula for Malay odds?
Answer:
For positive odds, the formula for calculating profit is:
```
Profit = stake x odds
```
For negative odds, the formula for calculating profit is:
```
Profit = stake x (-1 / odds)
```
In both cases the stake needs to be added to the profit in order to calculate the return. See the three examples further down.
To calculate the implied probability of Malay odds, use the following formulas:
* For positive odds, the formula for implied probability is: (1 / (odds + 1)) * 100
* For negative odds, the formula for implied probability is: (odds / (odds – 1)) * 100

Question: calculation formula for Malay odds example 1
Answer: Bet on a football match between Manchester United and Liverpool with odds of 0.75 for Manchester United to win at a stake of $100:
* Return = (stake x odds) + stake = $75 + $100 = $175
* Profit = stake x odds = $75

Question: calculation formula for Malay odds example 2
Answer: Bet on Roger Federer to beat Novak Djokovic in a tennis match with odds of 0.50 for Djokovic at a stake of $200.
* Return = (stake x odds) + stake = $100 + $100 = $200
* Profit = stake x odds = $100


Question: calculation formula for Malay odds example 3
Answer: Bet on the Los Angeles Lakers to beat the Boston Celtics at odds of -0.50 with a $200 stake:
* Return = (stake x (-1 / odds)) + stake = $400 + $200 = $600
* Profit = stake x (-1 / odds) = $400


Question: Waht is Pros of Malaysian odds?
Answer: 
* Similar to American Odds: Malay odds are simple and easy to understand for anyone accustomed to the American odds format (Moneyline). This is due to the use of positive and negative values to represent the payout.
* Clear Indication of Favourite and Underdog: The positive and negative decimal values make it clear which team is the favourite and which is the underdog, while the odds provide an indication of the potential payout.
* Simple Calculations for Payouts: The odds indicate the amount of profit that can be won for every 1 unit wagered, or what must be wagered to win 1 unit. This means that bettors can quickly determine their potential winnings without having to do complex calculations.

Question: Waht is Cons of Malaysian odds?
Answer: 
* Limited Availability: Indonesian odds are not widely used outside of Southeast Asia, which can make it difficult for bettors in other regions to find bookmakers offering these odds.
* Confusing for Beginners: While Malay odds are easy to use once you are familiar with them, they can be confusing for beginners to understand and calculate payouts.
* Difficult to Compare to Other Odds Formats: Odds in Malay format are not easily comparable to those in decimal or fractional odds. They'll need to be converted first.

Question: Are Malay odds the same as Indonesian odds?
Answer: Malay odds and Indonesian odds follow a similar pattern, but they aren’t the same. While both formats use 1.00 as a base and are presented as positive or negative numbers, there’s a big difference. Positive odds in Indo odds will be negative in Malay odds and negative odds in Indo are positive in Malay odds.

Question: What Are American Odds?
Answer: American odds are simply one way to express odds. A pick ’em is listed as “pk” or “pick” or “pick ’em”, depending on the sportsbook’s preference. There are two basic types: favorites and underdogs.
Favorites come with a ‘–’ symbol attached. The higher the absolute value of the number, the better the chance the bet will win. For example, a -200 favorite has a better chance to win than a -120 favorite. 200 is greater than 120, so this is what we mean by absolute value – you ignore the ‘–’ sign and take just the number when considering this.
Underdogs come with a ‘+’ symbol attached. The higher the number, the larger the underdog. So a +200 underdog has a better chance to win than a +500 underdog.

Question: What Do the American Odds Mean?
Answer: American odds always use a baseline value of $100. For favorites you are always risking the money to win $100, and with underdogs you risk $100 to win the amount.
* A -135 favorite means you must risk $135 to win $100 from the sportsbook. You either lose $135, win $100, or your wager is a push.
* A +350 underdog means you risk only $100, but you win $350. You either lose $100, win $350, or your wager is a push.

Question: How do you read American odds?
Answer: It’s easy to read American odds. Odds for favorites are accompanied by a minus (-) sign. Using -300 as an example, this means you must bet $300 to win $100. Odds for underdogs are accompanied by a plus (+) sign. If you see odds of +300, this means you will win $300 for every $100 you stake.

Question: How do you convert American odds to decimal?
Answer: If the American odds are positive, follow this formula: (American odds / 100 ) + 1 = decimal odds. If the American odds are negative, follow this formula instead: 1 – ( 100 / – American odds) = decimal odds.

Question: How do you convert American odds to fractional odds?
Answer: Converting American odds to fractional odds is easy. 
For positive odds, simply divide by 100. 
Therefore, American odds of +300 become 3/1 (300 / 100). 
For negative odds, the calculation is -100 divided by the American odds. 
Therefore, American odds of -300 become 1/3 (-100 / -300).

Question: Waht are Hong Kong odds?
Answer: Also known as HK odds, Hong Kong odds are considered one of the simplest odds formats. Plus (+) and minus (-) symbols are used to express the relationship between your initial stake and your potential profit. For instance, Team A might be +1.25, the draw may be +0.25, and Team B may be -1.25.

Question: How do Hong Kong odds work?
Answer: If you place a bet which is even odds (1/1 or evens in fractional odds or 2.00 in decimal odds), it will be displayed as ‘1’ in Hong Kong odds. Anything below that is usually a favourite and anything above is more of an outside shot. For instance, Team A would be the favourite at -1.25 versus Team B at +1.25.

Question: How do you convert HK odds to decimal odds?
Answer: You simply add 1 to the HK odds to get the decimal equivalent. For instance, you would add 1 to HK odds of 3.5 to get the decimal equivalent of 4.5. This works both ways. You simply subtract 1 from decimal odds to get HK odds.

Question: How much would you win in Hong Kong odds?
Answer: The bigger the number in Hong Kong odds, the more you will win. If you bet HK$100 on Kitchee to win the Hong Kong Premier League at odds of +5.00, you would win HK$500. If you bet HK$100 on Pegasus winning the league at odds of +10.00, you would win HK$1000.


Question: What do the euro odds mean?
Answer: European decimal odds represent the amount one wins for every $1 wagered. Depending on the negative or positive sign, American money line odds either indicate the amount one needs to wager to win $100 or the amount one would win for every $100 staked.

Question: How do you read Euro odds?
Answer: Decimal odds are the standard at European sportsbooks and in other markets across the globe. The odds appear as whole numbers with one or two decimal places. For a pair or range of choices, the lower of the decimal odds is the favorite.

Question: What is the format for Euro odds?
Answer: For Europeans the most common format is decimal, where a price such as 3.00 represents the equivalent of the 2/1 fractional price. In decimal prices the returned stake in a successful bet is 'built into' the odds.

Question: Indo Odds explained
Answer: Indonesian odds are similar to American odds, with plus (+) and minus (-) signs used to represent the favourite and underdog. Indo odds of +300 represent an underdog and mean you'll win Rp 300 for every Rp 100 bet. Odds of -300 represent the favourite and mean you must stake Rp 300 to win Rp 100.

Question: What are indonesian odds?
Answer: The Indonesian odds format, also known as “Indo odds”, is commonly used in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries.
In Indonesian odds, the odds are presented as positive (+) or negative (-) numbers. Positive numbers indicate underdogs and potential profit a bettor can earn per 1 unit if they win the bet, while negative numbers represent favourites and the amount a bettor must wager in order to win a profit of 1 unit.

Question: Provide me a example for Indo odds.
Answer: For example, if a football team is listed at +1.50 in Indonesian odds, it means that a bettor stands to profit 1.5 times their stake if the team wins the game. So, if a bettor places a bet of 100,000 Indonesian Rupiah on that team and they win, the bettor will receive 150,000 Rupiah in profit, in addition to their original stake.

Question: What is the calculation formula for Indo odds?
Answer: The formula for calculating the profit for a bet placed at positive (+) Indonesian odds bet is as follows:
```
Profit = stake x odds
```
The formula for calculating the profit for a bet placed at negative (-) Indonesian odds bet is as follows:
```
Profit = stake x (-1 / odds)
```
It is worth noting that Indonesian odds are simply American odds divided by 100. 

To calculate the implied probability of Indonesian odds, use the following formulas:

For positive odds, the formula for implied probability is: (1 / (odds + 1) x 100
For negative odds, the formula for implied probability is: (odds / (odds – 1))  x 100


Question: calculation formula for Indo odds Example 1
Answer:
Manchester United to win against Chelsea in a football match at odds of +1.75 with a stake of $100:
* Return = stake x (odds +1) = $100 x (1.75 + 1) = $275
* Profit = stake x odds = $175

Question: calculation formula for Indo odds Example 2
Answer:
Rafael Nadal to beat Novak Djokovic in a tennis match at odds of -2.0 with a stake of $100:
* Return = (stake x (-1 / odds)) + stake = $50 +$100 = $150
* Profit = stake x (-1 / odds) = $50

Question: calculation formula for Indo odds Example 3
Answer:
New York Yankees to beat Boston Red Sox in a baseball game at odds of -1.5 with a stake of £50:
* Return = (stake x (-1 / odds)) + stake = $33.33 +$50= $83.33
* Profit = stake x (-1 / odds) = $33.33

Question: What is Pros of Indonesian odds?
Answer: 
* Similar to American Odds: Indonesian odds are simple and easy to understand for anyone accustomed to the American odds format (Moneyline). This is due to the use of positive and negative values to represent the payout.
* Clear Indication of Favourite and Underdog: The positive and negative decimal values make it clear which team is the favourite and which is the underdog, while the odds provide an indication of the potential payout.
* Simple Calculations for Payouts: The odds indicate the amount of profit that can be won for every 1 unit wagered, or what must be wagered to win 1 unit. This means that bettors can quickly determine their potential winnings without having to do complex calculations.

Question: What is Cons of Indonesian odds?
Answer: 
* Limited Availability: Indonesian odds are not widely used outside of Southeast Asia, which can make it difficult for bettors in other regions to find bookmakers showing them.
* Confusing for Beginners: While Indonesian odds are easy to use once you are familiar with them, they can be confusing for beginners to understand and calculate payouts.
* Difficult to Compare to Other Odds Formats: Odds in Indonesian format are not easily comparable to those in decimal or fractional odds. They'll need to be converted first.


Question: What is the calculation formula for Hong Kong odds?
Answer:
The formula for calculating profit from a bet using Hong Kong odds is as follows:
```
Profit = stake x odds
```
For example, if you bet HK$100 at odds of 0.50, your potential profit would be HK$50 (HK$100 x 0.50 = HK$50), with a return of HK$150 (HK$50 profit + HK$100 stake).
It’s important to note that the higher the Hong Kong odds, the lower the implied probability of the bet winning. To calculate the implied probability of Hong Kong odds, you can use the following formula:
```
Implied Probability = (1 / (odds + 1)) x 100
```
Let’s say you have Hong Kong odds of 0.50 for an event. The implied probability is calculated as: (1 / (0.50 + 1) x 100 = 0.666 x 100 = 66.67%



Question: calculation formula for Hong Kong odds Example 1
Answer: Manchester United to win against Chelsea at odds of 0.75 with a stake of HK$500:
* Return = stake x (odds + 1) = HK$500 x (0.75 + 1) = HK$875
* Profit = stake x odds = HK$375


Question: calculation formula for Hong Kong odds Example 2
Answer: Rafael Nadal to win the French Open at odds of 1.25 with a stake of HK$1,000:
* Return = stake x (odds + 1) = HK$1,000 x (1.25 + 1) = HK$2,250
* Profit = stake x odds = HK$1,250


Question: calculation formula for Hong Kong odds Example 3
Answer: Golden State Warriors to win the NBA Championship at odds of 0.5 with a stake of HK$2,000:
* Return = stake x (odds + 1) = HK$2,000 x (0.5 + 1) = HK$3,000
* Profit = stake x odds = HK$1,000 

Question: What is Pros of Hong Kong odds?
Answer: 
* Easy to Understand: Hong Kong odds are very easy to understand for beginners. The format is similar to decimal odds, except it represents the profit instead of total winnings.
* Popular In Asia: Hong Kong odds are the standard odds format in many Asian countries, particularly in Hong Kong, where they are commonly used in horse racing and football betting.
* Potential For Value: ong Kong odds are used at Asian sportsbooks which are known to offer better value than equivalent selections available in other regions. So it's beneficial for bettors to understand how to interpret them.

Question: What is Cons of Hong Kong odds?
Answer:
* Limited Availability: Hong Kong odds are not as widely available as other odds formats. Many betting sites do not have it as an option.
* Language Barrier: Hong Kong odds are often displayed in Chinese characters, which can make it difficult for non-Chinese speaking bettors to interpret them.
* No Negative Odds: Hong Kong odds do not include negative odds, which makes it harder for US sports bettors to adapt to the format.


Question: What is the calculation formula for American odds?
Answer:
Calculating potential profit using American odds is not quite as simple as other odds formats as there are two separate calculations for positive and negative odds.
For positive odds, the formula for calculating profit is:
```
Profit = (Odds / 100) x Stake
```
For negative odds, the formula for calculating profit is:
```
Profit = (-100 / Odds) x Stake
```
In both cases the stake needs to be added to the profit in order to calculate the return. See the three examples further down.
To calculate the implied probability of American odds, use the following formulas:
* For positive odds, the formula for implied probability is: (100 / (odds + 100)) * 100
* For negative odds, the formula for implied probability is: (odds / (odds – 100)) * 100
For example, for odds of -120, the implied probability would be (-120 / (-120 – 100)) * 100 = 54.55%.



Question: calculation formula for American odds Example 1
Answer: Bet on the Dallas Cowboys to win the Super Bowl at +1200 odds with a $100 stake:
* Return = ((odds / 100) x stake) + stake = ((1200 / 100) x $100) + $100 = $1200 + $100 = $1300
* Profit = (odds / 100) x stake = $1200

Question: calculation formula for American odds Example 2
Answer: Bet on the Los Angeles Lakers to beat the Brooklyn Nets at -150 odds with a $200 stake:
* Return = ((-100 / Odds) x stake) + stake = ((-100 / -150) x $200) + $200 = $133.33 + $200 = $333.33
* Profit = (-100 / Odds) x stake = $133.33


Question: calculation formula for American odds Example 3
Answer: Bet on the Boston Red Sox to lose to the New York Yankees at +175 odds with a $50 stake:
* Return = ((odds / 100) x stake) + stake = ((175 / 100) x $50) + $50 = $87.50 + $50 = $137.50
* Profit = (odds / 100) x stake = $87.50

Question: What is Pros of American odds?
Answer:
* Clear Indication of Favourite and Underdog: The positive and negative numbers make it clear which team is the favourite and which is the underdog, while the odds provide an indication of the potential payout.
* Easy to Calculate Payouts: The odds indicate the amount of profit that can be won for every $100 wagered, or what must be wagered to win $00. This means that bettors can quickly determine their potential winnings without having to do complex calculations.
* Useful for American Sports: American odds are the standard format used in the United States. This means that bettors who are familiar with American odds will have no trouble finding a sportsbook that uses this format.

Question: What is Cons of American odds?
Answer:
* Confusing for Beginners: While American odds are easy to understand once you are familiar with them, they can be confusing for beginners to understand and calculate payouts.
* Difficult to Compare to Other Odds Formats: Odds in American format are not easily comparable to those in decimal or fractional odds. They'll need to be converted first.
* Limited International Appeal: While American odds are popular in North America and Canada, they are not widely used in other parts of the world, which can make it harder to compare odds across different sportsbooks and betting platforms.


Question: What are Decimal odds?
Answer: Decimal or “European” odds are a popular and intuitive format for expressing the potential winnings of an a bet. The format is used across Europe, and is the default format on sports betting exchanges.
Unlike other odds formats such as Fractional or American odds, decimal odds represent the total amount that will be paid out to the bettor if their bet is successful, including the original stake.


Question: What is the calculation formula for Decimal odds?
Answer: Decimal odds are presented as a number with two decimal places, such as 2.50 or 1.75. Calculating potential winnings with decimal odds is simple: you multiply the amount of the bet by the decimal odds. For the profit, you then subtract the stake as follows:
```
Profit = (stake x decimal odds) - stake
```
For example, if you bet €50 at odds of 2.00, your potential payout would be €100 (€50 x 2.00 = €100). The potential profit would be €50 (€100 return – €50 stake).

As decimal odds represent the total payout, it’s easy to compare odds across different bookmakers. Essentially the higher the decimal odds are, the higher the potential payout is.
Decimal odds can be converted into  percentages (known as the implied probability) using the following formula:
```
Implied Probability = (1 / decimal odds) x 100
```
Let’s say you have decimal odds of 2.5 for an event. The implied probability is calculated as: (1 / 2.5 x 100) = 0.4 x 100 = 40%



Question: calculation formula for Decimal odds Example 1
Answer: Manchester City to win against Chelsea at odds of 1.85 with a stake of €100:
* Return = stake x odds = €100 x 1.85 = €185
* Profit = return – stake = €185 – €100 = €85


Question: calculation formula for Decimal odds Example 2
Answer: Rafael Nadal to win the French Open at odds of 3.50 with a stake of €50:
* Return = stake x odds = €50 x 3.50 = €175
* Profit = return – stake = €175 – €50 = €125

Question: calculation formula for Decimal odds Example 3
Answer: Lewis Hamilton to win the Monaco Grand Prix at odds of 2.25 with a stake of €200:
* Return = stake x odds = €200 x 2.25 = €450
* Profit = return – stake = €450 – €200 = €250

Question: What is Pros of Decimal odds?
Answer:
* Easy to Understand: Decimal odds are very straightforward to understand and calculate. The number represents the total payout including the original stake, making it easy to determine potential winnings and compare odds across different bookmakers.
* Transparent: Decimal odds are transparent, and it is easy to see how much the bookmaker is charging for their services. This makes it easier for bettors to make informed decisions.
* Widely Used: Decimal odds are used by many bookmakers and betting sites around the world, making them a common and familiar format for sports bettors.
* Simple to Convert to Percentages: Decimal odds can be easily converted into probabilities by dividing 1 by the decimal odds and multiplying by 100.

Question: What is Cons of Decimal odds?
Answer:
* Unfamiliar to Many: Some bettors may be unfamiliar with decimal odds, particularly if they are used to other formats such as fractional or American odds. This could lead to confusion and mistakes when placing bets.
* No Indication of Underdogs: Decimal odds do not provide any indication of which team or player is considered the underdog. Bettors need to look at all outcomes to determine which is most likely to win.

Question: What are Fractional odds?
Answer: Fractional odds, also known as traditional odds or British odds, represent the ratio of the amount that will be won relative to the amount staked. They are commonly used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other countries that follow the British betting tradition.
Fractional odds are expressed in the form of a fraction, such as 5/1, 3/2, or 7/4. The first number in the fraction represents the amount that will be won if the bettor places a stake equal to the second number. For example, if the odds are 5/1 and a bettor places a stake of £1, they will make a £5 profit if the bet is successful, plus they will get their original £1 stake back, resulting in a total payout of £6.


Question: What is the calculation formula for Fractional odds?
Answer: In the example of 7/4 fractional odds, the potential profit is not immediately intuitive. To work out the profit of any fractional odds bet, you can use a simple formula:
```
Profit = stake x (numerator / denominator)
```
Therefore a £2 bet at 7/4 stands to make a profit of £2 x (7 / 4) = £3.50, and a total return of £5.50 (£3.50 + £2 stake).

Fractional odds can be converted into percentages (known as implied probabilities) using the following formula:
```
Implied Probability = (denominator / (denominator + numerator)) x 100
```
Here, the denominator refers to the number on the right side of the fraction, and the numerator refers to the number on the left side of the fraction.

For example, let’s say you have fractional odds of 1/10, the implied probability of the event occurring is (10 / (10+1) x 100) = 0.909 = 90.90%.




Question: calculation formula for Fractional odds Example 1
Answer: Liverpool to win against Manchester United at odds of 4/5 with a stake of £50:
* Return = (stake x (numerator / denominator)) + stake = (£50 x (4 / 5)) + £50 = £90
* Profit = return – stake = £90 – £50 = £40

Question: calculation formula for Fractional odds Example 2
Answer:  Tiger Woods to win the US Masters at odds of 5/1 with a stake of £25:
* Return = (stake x (numerator / denominator)) + stake = (£25 x (5 / 1)) + £25 = £150
* Profit = return – stake = £150 – £25 = £125


Question: calculation formula for Fractional odds Example 3
Answer: Serena Williams to win Wimbledon at odds of 2/1 with a stake of £100:
* Return = (stake x (numerator / denominator)) + stake = (£100 x (2 / 1) + £100 = £300
* Profit = return – stake = £300 – £100 = £200

Question: What is Pros of Fractional odds?
Answer:
* Widely Used In the UK: Fractional odds are the most common odds format used in the UK. Once you grasp the format, betting at British bookmakers becomes a lot simpler.
* Easy to Understand: Fractional odds are relatively simple to understand, even for novice bettors. They represent the ratio of the potential payout to the original stake.
* Clear Indication of Potential Profits: Fractional odds provide a clear indication of the potential profits from a bet. For example, if the odds are 2/1, you will win £2 for every £1 you bet.

Question: Waht is Cons of Fractional odds?
Answer:
* Confusing for Non-UK Bettors: Fractional odds can be confusing and difficult to understand for bettors who are accustomed to using another format.
* Less Precise Than Decimal Odds: Fractional odds are less precise than decimal odds, which means value can be lost due to rounding.
* Uncommon On Betting Exchanges: Fractional odds are used for fixed-odds betting at bookmakers and aren't available at all betting exchanges. This means you'll need to learn decimals if you want to start trading.


Question: What are implied odds?
Answer: In sports betting, implied odds or “implied probability” refers to the likelihood of a particular outcome occurring, as implied by the odds offered by a betting site. The implied odds are expressed as a percentage.
It’s important to note that betting sites do not usually present odds as percentages. Nonetheless, it’s important for bettors to understand the relationship between odds and percentages (implied odds).

Question: What is the calculation formula for implied odds?
Answer: The implied odds can be calculated by the simple formula:
```
Implied odds = 1 / decimal odds
```

Question: The Significance of Implied Odds
Answer: Bookmakers use probability to determine the odds they offer on a particular outcome.
For example, if a bookmaker calculates that a particular football team has a 50% chance of winning a game, they will base the odds around that probability. In this case, the fair decimal odds would be 2.0 (or even money), as the implied odds represent this chance: 1 / 2.0 = 50%. However, the bookmaker will factor in their margin, typically setting those odds at a lower value, such as 1.8, thereby gaining an advantage over the player.


Question: How bookmakers set their odds?
Answer: If a bettor determines that the probability of an outcome is higher than the implied probability suggested by the odds offered, this would be a wise bet to place.
For example, if a team has a 60% chance of winning a game, and the bookmaker is offering odds of 1.8 on that team winning, the bettor may see value in placing a bet because the implied probability (55.6%) is lower than the bettor’s estimated probability (60%). This is essentially value betting.

Question: What is Pros of Implied Odds?
Answer:
* Informs Betting Decisions: Implied odds can help bettors make more informed decisions by accounting for the real-life likelihood of an outcome occurring.
* Helps Bettors to Find Value: Understanding implied odds enables bettors identify when the odds do not accurately reflect the actual probability of an outcome, which can lead to finding value bets.

Question: What is Cons of Implied Odds?
Answer:
* Value Betting Requires Skill: Implied odds are only useful if the bettor is able to accurately form the probability of upcoming events. This requires a certain level of analytical/mathematical skill, which not all bettors may possess.

Question: Can you make a living from sports betting?
Answer: The answer you’ll usually find to that question is a confident, flat-out “no”. It’s often followed up with a clique such as “the bookie always wins”, or “it’s a mug’s game”.

Question: What is arbitrage betting?
Answer: Following on from Matched Betting is arbitrage betting — also referred to as “arbing” or “sure betting”.
Professional bettors ‘arb’ sports betting sites by covering all outcomes of an event, in order to profit from the difference in their odds.

Question: What is value betting?
Answer: ‘Value’, in betting terms, is presented when the odds suggest that the selection isn’t as likely to win as it really is. By picking value odds, the ‘edge’ is in the player’s favour.
here’s two main types of value bets:
* Odds that go on to fall (i.e they drop). If you are able to pre-empt when odds will decline in value, then you’re onto a winning strategy. When odds settle (just before the start of the sports event) at a lower price to what you’ve backed, then what you have achieved is a “value bet”. 
* Odds that imply an outcome is less likely to occur than reality. Rather than predicting a fall in the odds (and relying entirely on the accuracy of the market), you may already know that the real chance of an outcome happening is more likely than the odds suggest. For example, if the odds on offer are 10/1 at a Bookmaker, but you’ve calculated the “fair” chance as 7/1 then the payout on a win at the Bookmaker makes the bet profitable (assuming you’re appraisal is accurate). It’s therefore another type of “value bet”.

Question: What is a lay bet?
Answer: A lay bet is a type of bet where the bettor acts as the bookmaker and bets against a particular outcome. In other words, instead of betting on a specific team, player, or horse to win, the bettor is betting that the outcome will not happen.
For example, in a football match between Manchester United and Liverpool, a traditional bettor might bet on Manchester United to win the match. A lay bettor, on the other hand, could bet against Manchester United winning the match, effectively betting on Liverpool or a draw.
When you place a lay bet, you are essentially taking on the role of a bookmaker. This means that if the outcome you bet against happens, you will have to pay out the winnings to the person who bet on it. This potential payout is known as as the liability of a lay bet.
On the other hand, if the outcome you bet against does not happen, you get to keep the stake that was placed by the other person, minus any commission that may be charged by the platform or betting exchange you used to place the bet.
It’s important to note that lay betting is done through a betting exchange rather than a traditional bookmaker.


Question: The Appeal of Lay Betting
Answer: The main advantages of lay betting are:
* Increased Flexibility: Lay betting allows you to bet on the outcome of an event without having to back a particular selection.
* Better Odds: Laying a bet can often provide better odds than backing a selection. This is because you are effectively acting as the bookmaker and setting your own odds.
* Hedging Opportunities: Lay betting offers opportunities for hedging your bets. This means you can place a lay bet to cover your initial bet, reducing your risk and ensuring you don’t lose money if the outcome goes against you.
* No Liability Limitations: With lay betting, there are no limitations on the amount you can win. This is because you are not limited by the maximum payout offered by traditional bookmakers.

Question: What are some types of 50/50 situations?
Question: What are some types of 50/50?
Answer: Handicap, Over Under, Odd Even

Question: What is actual stake?
Answer: Now, there is a payout of -20.75. A player bets 100 yuan. When losing, the player will lose 100 x 20.75 = 2,075 yuan. 
Therefore, the amount deducted from the system when the player bets is 2,075 yuan, not 100 yuan (100 is the stake, 2,075 is the actual stake). 
Assuming this bet wins, how much money will the player get back from the system?
* Actual stake: 2,075
* Stake: 100
* Payout (DB Column Winlost): 2,075 + 100 = 2,175

Question: What is stake ?
Answer: Amount that the player enters when placing a bet.

Question: What is actual stake?
Answer: Money that a player may lose in the future.

Question: What is DB Winlost?
Answer: Money returned to the player after SBO settles.

Question: What is Sportsbook Winning?
Answer: Sportsbook Winning = Winlost - `actual stake`


Question: How do companies make money?
Answer: Bookmakers make money by taking a spread on the difference between the two odds.
In the first example, both teams have odds of 1.00. Player A bets $100 on each team.
* If Team A wins, SBO will pay Player A $100 for his bet on Team A, and SBO will win $100 from Player A for his bet on Team B.
In this case, regardless of whether Team A or Team B wins, SBO will make no money.

In the second example, both teams have odds of 0.98. Player A bets $100 on each team.
* If Team A wins, SBO will pay Player A $98 for his bet on Team A, and SBO will win $100 from Player A for his bet on Team B.
In this case, regardless of whether Team A or Team B wins, SBO will make $2.

Question: What is HDP?
Answer: Asian Handicap(HDP) is a style of betting where the bookmaker handicaps the two teams in a game before its commencement. Using Football as an example, the bookmaker gives a goals deficit to the team it thinks is more likely to win, and a head start to the team it thinks is less likely to win. The handicaps are expressed in goals, or fractions of goals. To win a bet, the End User, rather than backing a team to win, bets on it to overcome the handicap.

Question: How to read the Sport HDP Odds display on the Desktop version?
Answer: In the Desktop version, the HDP numbers will be displayed in the second column, 
followed by the home team and away team.
```
Home team
Away team
```
For example, if the display is as follows:
```
Home team 1-1.5
Away team 
```
This means that the home team is giving a handicap of 1-1.5 points to the away team.

Question: How to play Mix Parlay(MP) betting?
Answer: The game is played as follows:
* Choose three matches from a list of available matches.
* The odds of each match are multiplied together to determine the overall odds of your bet.
* To win, all three matches must have the outcome you predicted. This means that all three matches must be won, drawn, or have the correct half-time result.
For example, if you bet on three matches with odds of 2.00, 2.50, and 3.00, your overall odds would be 15.00. To win, all three matches would need to have the outcome you predicted.
