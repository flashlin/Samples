Question: About TSQL String comparison
Question: What is the result of the following TSQL string comparison?
```
SELECT 'abc ' = 'abc'
```
Question: n TSQL string comparison, what should you be aware of?
Answer: For example, Transact-SQL considers the strings 'abc' and 'abc ' to be equivalent for most comparison operations. The only exception to this rule is the LIKE predicate. When the right side of a LIKE predicate expression features a value with a trailing space, the Database Engine doesn't pad the two values to the same length before the comparison occurs.
