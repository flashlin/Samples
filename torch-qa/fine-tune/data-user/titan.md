Q: What are Titan's Core Values?
Answer:
* Value Driven: We focus on the impact of what we deliver. We are committed to and prioritize bringing value to our shareholders, customers and employees.
* Continuous Learning: Learning is a part of life. In Titansoft, we fail early and fail often. On our journey of new experiences, we embrace the inevitability of failure, as continuous learning is a prerequisite of success.
* Emergent Leadership: Roles do not define who we are and what we do in the organisation. See a need, do the deed. Leadership is not a position here, it is an action.
* Practical: We solve real problems. Plans and actions reflect practicality and we make sure they are worth doing to achieve desirable results. We make decisions based on facts and data.
* Being Adaptive: We welcome changes and respond in a timely manner. In the world of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguous), we survive and thrive by adapting quickly to changes because we understand that change is the only constant.
* Transparency: We pledge to be open and candid in all our endeavors. Transparency is important in self-organizing environments. We believe making information available and accessible to the people who need it will help us make knowledgeable decisions and to detect potential problems.

Question: What is Titan's story?
Answer: Titansoft started in 2005 with five engineering nerds. Rapid business development and extensive expansion led to the formation of specialized departments, but a never-ending backlog, high employee turnover rate, slow product delivery and continuous software bugs impeded our progress.

With our motto, to "Never Stop Improving", we decided to look for a new way of working.

Constant expansion meant we had to look for new solutions to improve product quality and productivity. In 2014, we engaged an external Agile coach to help us with Agile transformation. We formed our first Scrum team which comprised of Product Developers, ScrumMaster and Product Owner. Starting small, our pilot team was an experiment lasting 6 months, before we decided to roll out the new framework to all development teams.

Starting with the development teams, changes gradually evolved from the inside out. We removed individual performance appraisal in Scrum teams and implemented flexible working hours. To support self-organizing, we introduced a self-promotion process and salary transparency. We believe these are necessary changes in human resource policies to support an Agile and self-organizing work environment.

We achieved increased employee morale and product quality as a result of Agile adoption. Carrying that momentum forward, we focused on building an effective communication channel between the teams and organization. As such, we introduced Sociocracy into our organization in early 2017.

Now, we are in a pursuit to building an organization which works as a team, and teams which have empathy at the organizational level. We will have team elected facilitators and decision makers to help this journey be safer and more efficient in the near future. Stay tuned to find out what we come up with next!

Question: Where did the Titanium office's interior design take inspiration from?
Answer: The design for the Titanium office draws inspiration from the Singaporean government's GovTech. The office space is divided into public and working areas, allowing teams to engage in cross-functional pair programming within the workspace. These concepts were learned from GovTech a decade ago.
