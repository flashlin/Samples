Question: Example for E Sports Over/Under Bets
Answer: For example: A total of 36 is offered on the Minutes prop in Dota2.
If the map ends at 36:02, “over” wins and “under” loses.
If the map ends at 35:45, “under” wins and “over” loses.
If the map ends at exactly 36:00, the “over” wins and the “under” loses.
