Question:
# Turnover vs Rollover
these two terms are very similar.
Turnover focus on the amount while Rollover emphasize the multiple times.

For instance, we say
* Normal user has 3x rollover (read as “three times rollover”) to reach before they do a withdraw. 
  - MNL 1x now, with auto withdraw.
  - IOM 3x.
    - deposit 100,   3x  => 300 turnover
    - bet 100, win 120,  =>  +100 turnover
    - bet 50, lose =>    +150 turnover   (lose → turnover = 3x stake )
    - bet 20, lose 

* For rebate, user has to reach at least 1,000,000 VND turnover.
* Ranking promotion rank user base on their turnover.
* the lower rollover we limit, the easier user win money from us.
Answer:
@Question: What are the differences between Turnover and Rollover in Deposit Bonus?
@Answer:
These two terms are very similar. Turnover focuses on the amount while Rollover emphasizes the frequency.

For example, we say:
* A regular user needs a 3x rollover (read as “three times rollover”) before they can withdraw.
  - MNL user is currently at 1x with automatic withdrawals.
  - IOM user is at 3x.
    - Deposit 100, 3x => 300 turnover
    - Bet 100, win 120 => +100 turnover
    - Bet 50, lose => +150 turnover (loss → turnover = 3x stake)
    - Bet 20, lose

* For rebate, users need to achieve at least a 1,000,000 VND turnover.
* Promotional rankings are based on user turnover.
* The lower the rollover limit we set, the easier it is for users to win money from us.
