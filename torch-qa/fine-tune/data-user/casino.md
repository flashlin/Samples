Q: What Are Baccarat Roads?
Answer: Baccarat roads are simply a way of spotting trends in the results of each round. There are several types of roads and each one performs a different type of analysis. They help players understand the history of the game and spot any patterns. Some players will also use baccarat roads as part of their strategy to try to extrapolate what will happen next.

Answer: To begin the game, players simply must walk up to a Baccarat table and place a bet on either of the three outcomes: your hand winning, the banker’s hand wining, or a tie.

Q: What does the table display in the top left corner of Baccarat signify?
Q: Interpreting the top-left charts in Baccarat
Answer: Beat Plate: The terms B, BP, P, and PP are used to place bets on either the player or banker’s hand. B stands for Banker, P stands for Player, BP stands for Banker and Pair, and PP stands for Player Pair.

The second display table is the Big Road. The Big Road is the most commonly used roadmap in Baccarat. It records the outcome of each round but doesn’t record ties. A red circle 'O' represents the Banker win, while a blue circle 'O' represents the Player win. Players typically use the trend from the Big Road to decide whether to bet on the Banker or Player in the next round.

Q: Interpreting the top-right charts in Baccarat
Answer: The charts are Big Eye Boy, Small Road, and Cockroach Road, respectively.

Q: What is Bead Plate Road?
Answer: The Bead Plate Road is so named as originally, in land casinos, a tray or plate would be provided to players and they would record the results of each round by placing different colored beads into it. A winning Banker hand is recorded with red, a winning Player hand is recorded with Blue, and ties are recorded with green.

Usually, the Bead Road baccarat has at least six rows and twelve columns, meaning that it can record the result of at least seventy hands. Players begin in the top left corner and move down one row at a time. When the bottom of the column is reached, then players start again at the top of the next column to the right.

The Perfect Pairs side bet can also be recorded on the Bead Plate. If the Banker is dealt a pair, it is recorded with a red dot in the upper left corner of the cell while a Player pair is recorded with a blue dot in the lower right corner.

Q: What is Big Eye Boy in Baccarat?
Q: What is Big Eye Boy?
Answer: The starting point of the Big Eye Boy Road begins from the second row and second column of the Big Road, where the first row must display either Banker or Player. If neither appears in the first row, the starting point shifts to the subsequent row.

If there are no results in this position on the Big Road, the starting point becomes the first cell of the third row. The rules for the roadmap are as follows: the first cell of the Big Road observes for symmetry, red for symmetry, blue for asymmetry; the second cell looks for presence or absence, red if present or in a direct drop, blue if absent.

Alternating distribution between Banker and Player, switching from Banker to Player and from Player to Banker requires moving to the next row for recording. Consecutive Bankers and Players are written downwards, and if it's not possible to move downwards, move to the right. Symmetry: checks whether the number of red and blue in the first two cells of the current reference point in the Big Road are equal.

Symmetry: checks whether the number of red and blue in the first two cells of the current reference point in the Big Road are equal.

Presence or Absence: examines the second cell of the Big Road horizontally, if there's a cell before, regardless of its color, it's considered red; if there isn't, it's blue.

Direct Drop: if there's no cell before the previous cell and no cell before the subsequent cell, it's considered red.

Q: What is Big Eye Road?
Q: What is Big Eye Road in Baccarat?
Answer: The colors of the red and blue circles in the Big Eye Road do not correspond to Banker or Player but are determined based on whether there is a pattern in the outcome of each round in the Big Road.

Q: What is Small Road?
Q: What is Small Road in Baccarat?
Answer: The colors of the red and blue dots in the Small Road do not correspond to Banker or Player but are determined based on whether there is a pattern in the outcome of each round in the Big Road. When the latest result in the Big Road appears downwards, it's compared with the first two columns in a horizontal manner; if there's no match, a blue dot is drawn in the Small Road.

The Small Road is recorded as follows:
* If the hand being played leads to a new column in the Big Road, then the first and third columns to the left of the new column in the Big Road are compared. If they have the same number of entries, then a red circle is marked on the Small Road, otherwise a blue circle is marked.
* If the hand being played has the same outcome as the previous hand (not including ties), then the entry two cells to the left of the new entry in the Big Road is compared with the entry directly above it. If they are the same, then a red mark is made on the Small Road, otherwise a blue mark. In other words, look at the most recent entry in the Big Road, go two to the left and note the entry and then one up. If the entry after the move up is the same, then mark red, otherwise, blue.

Q: How to record the Small Road?

Q: What is no commission Baccarat?
Q: What is non-commission Baccarat?
Answer: Simply put, it’s a variant of Baccarat that replaces the 5% commission on banker wins. Instead, the returns are reduced to 0.5 odds if the banker wins with a 6.

Baccarat has some of the lowest house edge percentages among top casino games. As you may have guessed, the chance of one side winning is not always 50/50 despite the even money returns. This mostly comes down to the basic rules regarding when and why a third card is drawn.

Long story short, the banker has a slightly higher chance of winning. Statistically, 1.000 hands would result in 458 banker wins, 446 player wins, and 96 ties. Since players can decide to wanger on either side, you can see how this would be a problem for the casinos. To counteract this, the house usually takes a 5% cut on all wins resulting from banker bets.

There are some issues with this, though. Firstly, the players don’t like having to give up a piece of their winnings. Second, the casinos don’t like it because it slows down games and gives the dealer extra work. And so, they figured out a way to reduce the advantage of banker bets without charging a commission.

Their solution was to just reduce player winnings in one specific scenario – a banker win with a score of 6. If this happens, the player receives a payout at odds of 0.5/1. Everything else remains the same. All other bets are even-money, even other banker wins.

Q: Is No Commission Baccarat Good?
Answer: Well, the only factor to consider is the No Commission Baccarat house edge.
Let’s go back to our previous 1,000-hand example and say we’re betting $1 each time. The 5% commission rate pushes the stats in the house’s favour, resulting in a $10.90 net loss due to the house edge. Bear in mind that we’re only referring to the commission, and not the overall RTP.

As for commission-free baccarat games, the 6-score scenario would occur 54 times out of 1,000. Due to the reduced returns, the theoretical net loss would end up being around $15 – $4 worse than the regular version. This implies No Commission Baccarat RTP is lower – though it’s almost negligible.

Q: What are the Pros and Cons of non-commission in Baccarat?
Answer: No Commission Baccarat offers several advantages, such as:
* Potential for higher payouts due to the absence of a commission
* Ability to place more daring wagers without considering the commission

Q: The Role of Commission in Baccarat
Answer: The primary purpose of the commission in baccarat is to counterbalance the lower house edge that results from the banker’s slight advantage. This advantage stems from the banker’s play being contingent upon the player’s score, which makes winning banker bets more probable. However, winning tie bets, although less frequent, can also be an option, albeit with a higher house edge.

With a payout ratio of 8:1 for a tie bet in baccarat, the probability of winning a tie bet stands at 9.51%. The house edge for tie bets is 15.75% for a single deck and 14.36% for six- and eight-deck games.

Q: What is Cockroach Road?
Answer: Also known as The Cockroach Pig Road, this is the last one you need to understand. Once again, it is similar to the Small Road. However, this time it skips two columns to the left of the Big Road’s current column. Before starting the Cockroach Road, you need to wait until the entry after the first entry made in the Big Road’s fourth column.

The Cockroach Pig is recorded as follows:
* If the current hand creates a new column in the Big Road, then compare the first and the fourth columns to the left of the Big Road’s new column. If they are the same depth, then mark a red circle on the Cockroach Pig, otherwise mark a blue circle.
* If the current hand has the same outcome as the previous hand (not including ties), then you need to compare the entry three cells to the left of the Big Road’s new entry with the entry directly above it. If they are the same, then mark a red on the Cockroach Pig, otherwise, mark blue. In other words, look at the last mark made on the Big Road and then move three cells left. Next, move up, if there is no change mark red, otherwise, mark blue.

Q: How to record the Cockroach Road?
Answer: The Cockroach Pig is recorded as follows:
* If the current hand creates a new column in the Big Road, then compare the first and the fourth columns to the left of the Big Road’s new column. If they are the same depth, then mark a red circle on the Cockroach Pig, otherwise mark a blue circle.
* If the current hand has the same outcome as the previous hand (not including ties), then you need to compare the entry three cells to the left of the Big Road’s new entry with the entry directly above it. If they are the same, then mark a red on the Cockroach Pig, otherwise, mark blue. In other words, look at the last mark made on the Big Road and then move three cells left. Next, move up, if there is no change mark red, otherwise, mark blue.

Q: How are points calculated in Baccarat?
Answer: In poker, the points closest to nine or exactly nine win. Cards 10, J, Q, K are considered as 0 points. When the total points of two number cards exceed ten, only the digit in the unit place is considered. For instance, 15 points are seen as 5 points, and 10 points are considered as 0 points. An ACE is counted as one point, while number cards, except for 10, are calculated based on their face value.

Q: What are the betting options available in Baccarat?
Answer: In Baccarat, there are three main betting options:
* Banker Bet: This is a bet that the Banker's hand will win. The Banker hand has a slight edge over the Player hand, so this bet is the most popular option.
* Player Bet: This is a bet that the Player's hand will win. 
* Tie Bet: This is a bet that both hands will tie.

In addition to these three main bets, there are also a number of side bets available in Baccarat. These side bets are based on specific outcomes of the game, such as whether the winning hand will be a pair or a natural (a hand that totals 8 or 9 with the first two cards dealt). Side bets are generally considered to be more risky than the main bets, but they can also offer higher payouts.

Q: Interpreting the Big Road
Answer: The Big Eye Boy road, also known as the Baccarat Big Eye Road, is what is known as a derived road, as it interprets the information from the Big Road. It shows players whether there have been discernible patterns from the shoe so far or if the results have been random.

The first entry made in the Big Eye Boy road will be the hand after the first entry in the second column of the Big Road, as this is when there is enough information to try to spot a pattern. Each entry in the Big Eye Boy road relates to a specific entry in the Big Road. Red is used to represent a pattern while blue is used for randomness.

Q: How do you read baccarat roads?
Answer: Each baccarat road is read in a different way in baccarat. They consist of red and blue circles that represent the results of previous hands in different ways. For instance, with the Bead Plate Road, a red circle represents a Banker win, a blue circle represents a Player win and green represents a tie. If you want to learn exactly how to read all of the different roads, then simply take a look at the explanations on this page.

Q: How can I use baccarat roads to place a bet?
Answer: The baccarat roads are there to show you patterns in the results of previous rounds. Some roads, such as the Bead Plate, simply show the results themselves and it is up to you to spot the patterns. Other roads, such as the Cockroach Pig, highlight when there is a discernable pattern. If you believe that the next hand will follow a trend highlighted by the roads, then you can place your bet accordingly.

Q: What are derived roads?
Answer: Rather than showing the results of previous rounds, the derived roads look for patterns that can be discerned from the Big Road. Each of the Small Road, the Big Eye Boy and the Cockroach Pig zooms out to a different degree to see if there is a pattern. Essentially, they show how repetitive the shoe is (or isn’t). If a derived road a pattern, then players may wish to assume its continuation when placing their next bet.
