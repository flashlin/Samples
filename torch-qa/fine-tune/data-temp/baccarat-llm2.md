In Non-Commission Baccarat, banker bets pay 1 to 1 except when the banker wins with a total of six points, in which case only half of the bet is paid out.
* "Banker bets" refer specifically to bets that are placed on the banker's hand to win. These bets have different rules and payouts compared to player bets.

The objective is to get as close to 9 points as possible without going over. Different bet types like Player, Banker, Tie, and Pair bets have various odds of winning, as stated above.

So, Baccarat is the card game, and payout odds determine the winnings for winning bets placed in the game.
Question: What are the differences between "Banker bets" and "Commission"?
Answer: In traditional Baccarat, when a Banker bet wins, a commission is deducted automatically, which is equal to 5% of the win amount.

Instead, the Banker wins even money, but in the event when the Banker wins with a total of six points, only half of the amount placed on the Banker will be paid.
