## Rule: Default color configuration
- Set the default foreground color to white.
- Set the default background color to DarkGray for `ColoredChar` instances.

## Rule: Handle ASCII characters with specific length
- If `Chars[n].Char` has an ASCII length of 2, ensure that the next character is '\0'.

## Rule: Automatic handling of multi-byte characters
- If setting `Chars[n].Char` to a character like 'ä¸­' that exceeds 2 bytes, automatically set `Chars[n+1].Char` to `'\0'`.

## Rule: Handle left/up/down cursor movement
- When the cursor moves left, up, or down to position `n`, if `Chars[n].Char` is `'\0'`, move further left or up/down until a non-`'\0'` character is found.

## Rule: Handle right cursor movement
- When the cursor moves right to position `n`, if `Chars[n].Char` is `'\0'`, continue moving right until a non-`'\0'` character is encountered.

## Rule: Simplified Switch Case Statements
- Ensure each case statement within a switch only calls one method followed by a `break`.
- Extract logic from lengthy case statements into distinct methods.

## Rule: Simplify VimNormalMode
- Exclude `private bool _continueEditing = true;` from `VimNormalMode`.
- Allow `VimEditor` to independently handle looping through `WaitForInput`.

## Rule: Control Rendering in Vim Modes
- In `VimVisualMode::WaitForInput()` and `VimNormalMode::WaitForInput()`, refrain from calling `Instance.Render()` at the conclusion.
- Delegate rendering control to `VimEditor`.

## Rule: Uniform Cursor Style Settings
- Apply cursor styling using `Console.Write("\x1b[6 q");` for a vertical line cursor consistently across all platforms.
- Apply cursor styling using `Console.Write("\x1b[2 q");` for a block cursor consistently across all platforms.
- No platform-specific conditional checks are needed for cursor styling.


## Rule: Cursor Positioning at End of Document
- When the cursor reaches the end of the document, keep it positioned on the last character, not merely beyond the text's end.
