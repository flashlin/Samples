# Conclusion
* The 34B Model requires more training data than the 7B Model, and this is a universally acknowledged fact.
* Quality QA data leads to better training outcomes compared to data lacking in quality.
* Extracting reliable knowledge solely from sporadic snippets of support without the willingness to create instructional documentation is exceedingly challenging.
