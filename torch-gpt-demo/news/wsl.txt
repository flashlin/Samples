If executing commands in WSL2 is slow, it may be because WSL2 by default mounts the C: and D: drives in the PATH, 
causing it to scan these drives when executing commands. 
However, WSL2's performance for accessing files across systems is poor.

To resolve this issue, you can disable the automatic mounting feature.
In WSL, modify the `/etc/wsl.conf` file and add the `[interop]` section with the `appendWindowsPath = false` setting. 

```
[interop]
appendWindowsPath = false
enabled = false
```

Then, restart the WSL.
